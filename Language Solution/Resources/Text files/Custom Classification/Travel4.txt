Cultural Heritage Travel: 

Cultural heritage travel focuses on exploring the historical, artistic, and traditional facets of a destination. Travelers immerse themselves in the local culture, visiting historic sites, museums, art galleries, and attending cultural festivals. This type of travel allows individuals to gain a deeper appreciation of the past and present of the places they visit, understanding the stories, practices, and people that have shaped them. It's a way to connect with humanity's diverse heritage and to recognize the value of preserving these cultural treasures for future generations.
