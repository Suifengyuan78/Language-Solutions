Plant-Based Cuisine: 

Plant-based cuisine is gaining popularity as more people adopt vegetarian and vegan diets for health, ethical, and environmental reasons. This culinary style focuses on dishes that are entirely derived from plants, excluding all animal products. Innovative chefs are exploring creative ways to use vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds to craft meals that are both nutritious and satisfying. From gourmet vegan restaurants to casual plant-based cafes, this trend is redefining how we perceive and enjoy vegetables and fruits, making them the stars of the dining experience.
